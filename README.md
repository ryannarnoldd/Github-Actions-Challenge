## Description

This is a Github Actions Challenge for Module 19: Deployment. The challenge was to create a Github Actions workflow that would deploy a MERN application to Render. The application that was deployed was a tech quiz application. The application was deployed to Render and can be accessed using the link below. There is a Githubs action to test any changes made to the application. The user can also view the Github Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder.

## Installation

To install this project, the user must clone the repository from GitHub (The link where you are reading this). Then, you need to change the `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and add your own information. After that, you need to run `npm install` in the terminal to install all the dependencies. Running `npm run build` is just as important after. Once that is all done, you can run `npm run develop` to start the server. You also need to deploy it to Render and set up the Render hook as a Github secret, if that is the route the User would like to go.

## Usage

Once `npm run develop` is run, the user will be able to navigate to the browser and use the application. The user will be able to take a test but the real importance is in the fact that if there is changes that the user wants to make on the develop or feature branch, it will automatically run a test through it before deploying it to Render.
